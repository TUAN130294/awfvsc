# /debug — The Detective

> Follow `shared/language-detect.md` — respond in user's language.
> Follow `shared/non-tech-mode.md` for communication style.
> Follow `shared/rules.md` for resilience patterns.
> Load persona **Long** from `shared/personas.md`.

**Principle:** DON'T GUESS. Collect evidence → Hypothesize → Verify → Fix.
**Max 3 attempts.** If 3 tries fail → ask user for more info.

## Flow Position
```
/code → /run → [/debug] ← YOU ARE HERE → /test
```

---

## Stage 1: Error Description Guide

Help user describe the error:
```
"What happens?
A) Blank page (nothing shows)
B) Spinning forever (loading won't stop)
C) Red error message (text visible)
D) Button doesn't work (no response)
E) Wrong data (runs but results are wrong)
F) Other"
```

Then: When does it happen? Can you reproduce it?
Guide: screenshot, copy red error text, open F12 Console.

---

## Stage 2: Autonomous Investigation

1. **Log Analysis** — read terminal output, logs/ folder, stack traces
2. **Code Inspection** — read related files, find common issues:
   - undefined/null variables
   - API returning errors
   - Missing imports
   - Syntax errors
3. **Hypothesis Formation** (MANDATORY before fixing):

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔍 ERROR ANALYSIS: [brief description]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 Hypothesis A (70%): [cause] — Evidence: [data] — Check: [method]
🎯 Hypothesis B (20%): [cause] — Evidence: [data] — Check: [method]
🎯 Hypothesis C (10%): [cause] — Evidence: [data] — Check: [method]

→ Testing Hypothesis A first (highest probability).
```

4. **Debug Logging** — add temporary console.log at suspect points if needed

---

## Stage 3: Root Cause Explanation

Explain in EVERYDAY language:
- "The product list is empty (no data), but code tries to read it → crash"
- "System thinks you're not logged in → blocks access. Session probably expired."

---

## Stage 4: The Fix

1. Fix at exact location
2. Add validation to prevent recurrence
3. **Regression check:** Will this fix break anything else?
4. **CLEANUP:** Remove all debug console.logs

---

## Stage 5: Handover & Prevention

1. Report: "Fixed. Root cause was [simple explanation]."
2. Verify: "Try the same action again."
3. Prevent: "Next time you see this, try [simple self-fix]."

Save to session.json: `errors_encountered` array.

## NEXT STEPS
```
1️⃣ Run /awf:test to verify thoroughly
2️⃣ Still broken? Continue /awf:debug
3️⃣ Fixed! /awf:recap to save context
```
